/**
 * Class that implements ShellCommand interface.
 * Represents implementation for massrename shell command.
 * Command takes 4 or 5 arguments based on subcommand.
 * First argument is source directory, second destination directory, third subcommand,
 * forth mask, and fifth expression for new name building.
 * Directory path can be relative path which will be add to current directory path.
 * Command is used for mass-renaming/moving files that are directly in source directory.
 * Files will be moved to destination directory, which can be similar to source directory.
 * MASK is a regular expression written in accordance with the syntax supported by the Pattern class
 * that selects DIR1 files to which the renaming / moving procedure is also applied at all.
 * Command had 4 subcommands. Filter which writes files accepted by mask, 
 * groups that writes all groups given by mask, takes 4 arguments, show that shows expected new names of files.
 * Expects 5 arguments so as command execute which does replacing and renaming of files.
